# Contributing Guidelines


## Reporting issues

If you have a question, or have a problem using it, please read the [README](README.md) before filing an issue. Also check with the current issues on our Issues Tracker.

## Contributing a pull request

 1. Submit a comment to the relevant issue or create a new issue describing your proposed change.
 2. Do a fork, develop and test your code changes.
 3. Make commits of logical units with good commit message
 4. Submit a pull request.

You'll get feedback about your pull request as soon as possible.

### Commit messages

Your commit messages ideally can answer two questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the “what” and the body of the commit should describe the “why”.

As a good practice, when creating a pull request, its comment should reference the corresponding issue id.

Happy hacking ;)
